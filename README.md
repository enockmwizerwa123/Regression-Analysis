# Regression-Analysis
We are going through four kinds of Regression model and showing the differece between tham.
The main difference between `simple linear regression`, `polynomial regression`, `ridge regression`, and `lasso regression` lies in the complexity of the model and the regularization techniques used. Here's a brief explanation of each:

# Simple Linear Regression:

Simple linear regression is the basic form of regression modeling.
It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (y).
The model equation is of the form: $y = b0 + b1*X$, where b0 is the intercept and b1 is the coefficient.
Simple linear regression aims to find the best-fit line that minimizes the sum of squared residuals between the predicted and actual values.
Polynomial Regression:

# Polynomial regression:
Polynomial regression is an extension of simple linear regression that models the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (y) as an nth-degree polynomial.
It allows for a nonlinear relationship between the variables.
The model equation is of the form: $y = b0 + b1*X + b2*X^2 + ... + bn*X^n$, where n represents the degree of the polynomial.
Polynomial regression can capture more complex patterns and relationships compared to simple linear regression.

# Ridge Regression:
Ridge regression is a form of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting.
It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which is the sum of squared residuals, to shrink the coefficient values.
The penalty term is the L2 norm of the coefficient vector multiplied by a regularization parameter (alpha).
Ridge regression is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity (high correlation between predictors).

# Lasso Regression:
Lasso regression, similar to ridge regression, is a form of linear regression with regularization.
It also adds a penalty term to the loss function but uses the L1 norm of the coefficient vector instead of the L2 norm.
The L1 penalty promotes sparsity and can set some coefficient values to zero, effectively performing feature selection.
Lasso regression is useful when dealing with high-dimensional data and when there is a need to identify the most important features.
Both ridge regression and lasso regression provide regularization to prevent overfitting and handle multicollinearity. However, ridge regression tends to shrink the coefficient values towards zero, while lasso regression can set some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.
